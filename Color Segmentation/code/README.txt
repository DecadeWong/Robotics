The my_detector.py is my top_level file which i call myAlgorithm function to do the red barrel detection. 

The my_detector.py is simply a I/O file, to run my program, just pull all file in same directory. 

There is also a file called my_function which i call them in myAlgorithm.

The other file in this zip file is what I use to extract training data, and gaussian model parameter.

Also, the Library I used in this project including numpy, cv2, pylab, PIL, math.
